## Real Life Scenarios

### Delete with custom key
You want to delete entities, but you don't have the primary key. The `ColumnPrimaryKeyExpression` lets you use as a key any property or combination of properties.

```csharp
bulk.AutoMapKeyName = "Code";
bulk.BulkDelete(dtCustomers.AsEnumerable().Take(2));
```

```csharp
bulk.AutoMapKeyExpression = customer => customer.Code;
bulk.BulkDelete(customers.Take(2));
```
